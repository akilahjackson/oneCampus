• the oversight of research with dangerous pathogens; and

• An investigation of the prospective standards and implementing capabilities of a comprehensive global nuclear material accounting system.
• An evaluation of the security benefits, costs, and risks of expanding nuclear energy production using different types of small modular reactors (SMRs) and associated fuel cycle arrangements.
• An analysis of the strategic and moral imperatives underlying the dispute over Iran's nuclear program, including a look at how the issue is portrayed in the news media.
