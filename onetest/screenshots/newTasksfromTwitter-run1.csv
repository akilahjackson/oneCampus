iPAC aspires to be an innovative and forward looking research and education facility that explores social, policy, and technology aspects of information access and use across cultural institutions, government agencies, and other information-based organizations; communities; and populations.
iPAC focuses on four major areas of research and education: 
Libraries, Cultural, and Public Institutions - Research on institutions, such as public libraries, school library media centers, archives, museums, and government agencies that are the sources of information, resources, services, and unifying space within their communities.
Policy - Analysis of the policies that shape the ways in which these institutions can serve their communities, as well as the roles of these institutions as access points for and providers of government and other information and services in society.
Diverse Populations - Advocacy and emphasis on the ways in which institutions and policies can promote inclusive information access and services for individuals and communities, including the underserved, underrepresented, and disadvantaged by embracing innovative approaches to diversity.
Preservation - Reseach and best practices on the preservation of the cultural record, cultural objects, and the assessment and conservation of materials particularly in digital formats.

You can help change this! Use our interactive tool to virtually walk through city streets and mark accessibility attributes such as missing curb ramps, blocked or overly narrow sidewalks, and broken pavement. Our focus is currently on Washington DC—so, if you've never been there, enjoy walking through the U.S. Capitol—but we plan on launching in other cities soon (including outside the US). Your data will be used to create new types of map-based accessibility tools, such as AccessScore, an interactive map of a city's accessibility, and RouteAssist, personalized routing algorithms based on a user's reported mobility level.

We also have some secret sauce: to scale our approach, your labels are also being used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically find future accessibility problems.","Help us make sidewalks more accessible for everyone by UMD's Makeability Lab","","http://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu","ACTIVE","NONE","1.0.0","3644","","1390,1392,1394,1395,1397,1398,1400,1389","1102",""

Because ours is a small program, our members have close ties with one another and become friends throughout college and beyond. Anne Arundel Hall, at the center and highest point on campus, is our home. Here, we reside, have our offices and many of our classes, and hold most of our social and academic events. Our lounge has a grand piano which many of our members play, displays art created by our students, and has a projection TV on which films are often screened. In our kitchen we prepare brownies to share, pancakes for Mardi Gras, and popcorn for movie nights.

While Honors Humanities sponsors a variety of events throughout the year to foster community, the Living & Learning side of the program also allows for events developed by the Honors Humanities Council, a group of ten students chosen by their peers. Our students hold humanities happy hours, open mic nights, and holiday gift-exchanges.

That's where we come in. Here at Maryland PIRG Students, we organize college students to solve some of the world's most pressing public interest problems.

Maryland PIRG Students is an independent statewide student organization that works on issues like environmental protection, consumer protection, and hunger and homelessness. Since 1973 Maryland PIRG students have been making a real difference in people's lives and winning concrete changes to build a better world.

We give students the skills and opportunity to practice effective citizenship. Both here on campus and out in the world, we mobilize students to investigate big social problems, come up with practical solutions, convince the media and public to pay attention, and get decision-makers to act.
